# Week 1: Introduction to Domain/Problem

## Topics
How can we use image analysis and visual feature extraction to
  meaningfully describe works of art?

### Overview of the quarter / What to expect:

* What is artistic style: What are the visual qualities that 
  lend artworks their distinctive, recognizable style?
* What does style mean: how do artists, art historians, 
  cultural producers, and cultural consumers (the public) 
  understand visual style?
* Quantifying images: what feature extraction and image analysis
  techniques best capture significant traits of visual style? 
  How can we meaningfully represent style with quantitative measures?
* Evolution of style: Explore the progression towards abstraction 
  in the work of painter Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) as a case study of
  a dramatic evolution in visual style over a compressed time period.
  Exemplar for the development of abstraction in 20th century art. 
* Extensions: How can we use these quantitative cultural analytic 
  methods to address diverse questions in diverse media, understanding
  how art is created and perceived?

## Homework

### Reading

* [Quantifying Abstraction In Art: Mondrian](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/4/11/quantifying-modrian-journey-to-abstraction), Jason Bailey, Artnome, 2018,  

* [Mondrian vs Rothko: footprints and evolution in style space](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2011/06/mondrian-vs-rothko-footprints-and.html), Lev Manovich et. al, Software Studies Lab, 2011

* [Reply to Mondrian vs Rothko: footprints and evolution in style space](https://web.archive.org/web/20120717071426/http://iwasnteventhere.tumblr.com/post/7882377942/reply-to-mondrian-vs-rothko-footprints-and-evolution), Ryan Anderson, Tumblr via wayback machine, 

### Discussion Questions

* What are the quantities and image statistics used to measure and 
  describe Mondrian’s work in Bailey’s project? In Manovich’s project? 

* Are these image statistics meaningful descriptions of the works of art?
  What could be other fruitful measures/analyses of images as data?

* What do computational/quantitative approaches to art analysis provide
  that traditional art history/criticism do not? What do they lack?

* What other visual/cultural data sets would be interested to analyze this way?

These questions approach topics that we will spend the majority of the
quarter answering! These are merely to set context!
