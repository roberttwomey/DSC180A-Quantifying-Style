### Assigned Readings

- [The Science of Culture? Social Computing, Digital Humanities and Cultural Analytics](http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/088-cultural-analytics-social-computing/cultural_analytics_article_final.pdf), Lev Manovich, 2015. 
- [Data Science and Computational Art History](http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/087-data-science/manovich_digital_art_history.pdf), Lev Manovich, 2015.

### Discussion Questions

Questions on 'The Science of Culture':
- Manovich claims that Cultural Analytics is the study of "everything created by everybody", a grand scope. What are cultural forms that may be difficult to quantify and assess through numeric features?
- What is a way that demographic details about the creators or audience could be important to the quantitative analysis of visual style?
- Manovich includes simulation alongside deterministic and probabilistic methods as scientific paradigms. How could simulation be used as a technique in the computational study of culture?

Questions on 'Data Science and Computational Art History':
- Manovich mentions the idea from digital humanities that all data is "constructed." Choices as to what is included/excluded from an analysis/data set produces bias. What is an example of how the curation of cultural data set or analysis could manifest bias? Can you think of a way to correct for this bias?
- Give an example of a "semantic gap" in the application of data science to the arts: what is a quality of a work of culture/art/music/literature that you can describe, subjectively, but that you think would be difficult to quantify?
- This article was published in the inaugural issue of the Digital Art History Journal (https://dahj.org/articles). Looking at their archives, find an article/study that you think sounds interesting and post the title along with a description of why you are interested in it.
