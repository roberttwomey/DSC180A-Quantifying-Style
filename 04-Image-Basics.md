# Week 4: Image Basics - Domain Specific Technique

## Assigned Readings
* [Quantifying Abstraction In Art: Mondrian](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/4/11/quantifying-modrian-journey-to-abstraction), Jason Bailey, Artnome, 2018,  
* [Mondrian vs Rothko: footprints and evolution in style space](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2011/06/mondrian-vs-rothko-footprints-and.html), Lev Manovich et. al, Software Studies Lab, 2011
* [Reply to Mondrian vs Rothko: footprints and evolution in style space](https://web.archive.org/web/20120717071426/http://iwasnteventhere.tumblr.com/post/7882377942/reply-to-mondrian-vs-rothko-footprints-and-evolution), Ryan Anderson, Tumblr via wayback machine, 2012.

### Discussion Activities

* Discuss responses to Manovich / Cultural Analytics Articles
* Look at image processing notebook.

### Homework

Please look through the following image processing code examples: [basic-image-stats.ipynb](basic-image-stats.ipynb) and then create your own notebook to attempt the following: 

* Load a single Mondrian image
  * Compute resolution (pixel count), mean saturation, mean brightness.
  * Compute the grayscale variance (Value in the HSV image) for your painting. 
  * Compute the per-rown grayscale variance
  * Approximate an "edge score"
  * Implement all of the above as functions.
* Data Cleaning
  * Plot a histogram of resolutions of your scraped images

Bring your jupyter notebook to class for Wed 2/5 Discussion.
