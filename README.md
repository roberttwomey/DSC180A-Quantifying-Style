# DSC180A-Quantifying-Style

How can we use image analysis and visual feature extraction to meaningfully describe works of art?

This is the Arts Domain track within the [Data Science Capstone (DSC180) for 2020](https://github.com/afraenkel/DSC180A-DS-Methodology).

## Introduction

* Tags: cultural analytics, artistic style, visual culture, quantifying culture
* Data: works of art! for instance the complete works of Mondrian(catalogue raisonne), digital images, bibliographic data
* Methods: image processing, feature extraction, clustering, visualization

Art works are often described in terms of distinct phases clustering 
thematic and aesthetic approaches (for instance Picasso’s Blue Period), 
and art historians narrate the evolution of individual style (for 
instance Mondrian’s passage from representational landscapes to pure 
abstraction) to describe conceptual advancement in the field. 
Additionally, contemporary image processing and computer vision 
techniques provide a wealth of newly-available features describing
the content of images. Taking art as data, how can we use these 
feature extraction and analytic techniques to meaningfully describe,
quantify, and draw conclusions about the content of art works? 
This project starts with the analysis of historical works of fine 
art, with potential extension to broad categories of contemporary 
cultural image production.
